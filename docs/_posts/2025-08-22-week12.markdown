<h3>A Note of Gratitude</h3>

As I wrap up my 12-week internship, I would like to thank everyone who guided and supported me throughout this journey. This internship has been a truly rewarding learning experience, with each week bringing something new to explore whether it was developing a new feature or fixing a tricky bug. I am especially grateful to my mentor - Jose María Cañas for his constant guidance, patience, and encouragement, which helped me grow both technically and professionally. I would also like to thank the supportive community at Robotics Academy for being there whenever I was stuck. Once again, thanks everyone for making this summer memorable.
