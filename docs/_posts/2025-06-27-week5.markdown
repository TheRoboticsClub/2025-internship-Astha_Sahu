This week I completed the following tasks:

- Co-ordinated with Fernando to test the new car in F1 circuit
- Made a Work in Progress Video and posted in on YouTube
- Looked into [marker_visual_loc.world](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsInfrastructure/blob/humble-devel/Worlds/marker_visual_loc.world) and [autoparking world files](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsInfrastructure/blob/humble-devel/Worlds/autoparking_prius_360lidar.world)
- Started working on the road junction world

<h3>New World</h3>

![new world](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/2025-internship-Astha_Sahu/blob/main/docs/_posts/images/rj_world.png?raw=true)

The new world so far has the following additions:

- 10 m wide roads
- 3 m wide sidewalks
- a stationary red hatchback car (static)
- new ackermann car
- traffic lights
- Pine trees
- UK-road junction grids
- A Pedestrian (in motion)

<h3>Things to be added</h3>

In the following week I will be adding the following to the world:

- Moving cars
- More lamposts/trees
- Buildings
- Grass patches

<h3>Issues Faced</h3>

I noticed that Gazebo Harmonic doesn't work with custom shaders and even the classic ones listed on material file gazebo.material were not being rendered smoothly. 

> From [API Reference 8.9.0](https://gazebosim.org/api/sim/8/migrationsdf.html#:~:text=Materials) "Gazebo does not support Ogre material files like Classic does, because Gazebo can be used with multiple rendering engines."

For now, I have used solid colors. However, in the following week, I will explore some of the alternate ways to add textures.
