This week I completed the following tasks:

- Added a spawning and despawning script for continuous traffic
- Optimized the use of sensors and cameras
- Started working on the solution

<h3>Spawning and despawning</h3>

Added a custom python script and used it in the world file using the PythonSystemLoader plugin.
The script subscribes to the world/world_name/create and world/world_name/remove. A car spawns every 8 secs and has a lifespan of 18 secs. A maximum of 3 instances of car and a minimum of 2 instances can exist at a time. The cars are detectable in lidar.

<h3>Sensor and camera update</h3>

The following updates have been made:

- Front ray sensor has been removed
- The rear view camera has been removed
- FOV of two side cameras has been improved
- The top 360° lidar is now used for 120° only

The following improvements have been made after comparing their performance and utility. This has improved the computation time a lot and reduced lagging.
