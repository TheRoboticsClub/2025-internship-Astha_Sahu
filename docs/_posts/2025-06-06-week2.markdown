This week I completed the following tasks:

- Researched the backend and working of Autoparking exercise
- Looked for ackermann steering car models in Gazebo Harmonic
- Started working on migration of autoparking exercise to Gazebo Harmonic

<h3>Summary</h3>

After, going through the exercises backend, I have created a plan for migration. I will begin by updating the model files in CustomRobots directory and then update the world files in World Directory. After creating a launcher for the updated world, to test the model and the world, I have to create a RADI with Robotics Infrastructure flag to the branch name. 
I have updated the ackermann car model in my local setup to Gazebo Harmonic. I will be working on the world files next.
