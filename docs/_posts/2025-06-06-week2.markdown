This week I completed the following tasks:

- Looked into and understood the backend and working of Autoparking exercise
- Looked for ackermann steering car models in Gazebo Harmonic
- Started working on migration of autoparking exercise to Gazebo Harmonic
- Forked and cloned RoboticsInfrastructure repository
- Set up developer environment

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p> This week, I focused on understanding the backend and overall workflow of the Autoparking exercise. I'm currently working on migrating this exercise to Gazebo Harmonic, using a Prius Ackermann steering model. </p>

<p> To begin the migration, I updated the necessary model URIs and working on updating and integrating the required Gazebo plugins. This integration is being handled using the ros_gz bridge, which connects ROS 2 (Humble) with Gazebo Harmonic for plugin communication and sensor data exchange. </p>

<p> I also forked and cloned the RoboticsInfrastructure repository and created a dedicated branch for my work. The development environment has been set up successfully, and Iâ€™ve verified that the frontend for the Autoparking exercise launches as expected. </p>
