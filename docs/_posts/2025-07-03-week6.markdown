This week I completed the following tasks:

- simulated traffic (moving cars)
- Added lamposts
- Modified traffic light
- Got added as a contributor on Robotics Academy Repo

<h3>New World</h3>



- 10 m wide roads
- 3 m wide sidewalks
- red hatchback cars (moving at a speed of 15m/s)
- traffic lights
- UK-road junction grids
- A Pedestrian (in motion)
- Pine trees
- Lamposts

<h3>Handling Simulation Lag</h3>

While running the simulation was slow and lagged a bit. Hence, I removed shadows and textures. Although the simulation is still slow, but it's much better than before.
